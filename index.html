    <p>In my final capstone project, I am undertaking the task of creating a captivating 3D environment inspired by the concept art of Max Suleimanov. This endeavor involves a meticulous process encompassing various software and techniques to bring the envisioned scene to life.To Start, I will employ Blender for the modeling and sculpting of the buildings.For the natural elements, such as cliffs and rocks, I plan to utilize Megascans within the Unreal Engine.To simulate the waterfall realistically, I will leverage the power of Houdini and its flip fluid tools. </p>

        This week, I worked more on completing the buildings for the 3D environment. My goals for the end of this week are to finish the base structure of the building and begin sculpting the details, such as wear and tear and cracks. Furthermore, after talking to my mentor, he suggested that I use Megascans for the cliffs instead of modeling them from scratch. Additionally, he recommended creating a procedural system in Houdini that will generate cracks and damages on my building. I will be incorporating his suggestions into my project.</div>

        <div class="summary"> Throughout this week, I dedicated my efforts to crafting the cliff model that would serve as the centerpiece for the main waterfall. To achieve this, I merged various models from Megascans, seamlessly blending them to construct the terrain. I remeshed it and integrated it into Houdini, where it assumed the crucial role of simulating collisions for the main waterfall.In addition to this, I also worked on the collisions for the two smaller waterfalls. Guided by valuable input from my mentor, I embraced the innovative idea of using trim sheets to texture repeating materials across the mesh.  I am eagerly looking forward to incorporating these trim sheets into my work in the coming week.
